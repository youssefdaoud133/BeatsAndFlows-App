## Overview

This application is designed as an interactive educational tool to help users understand the physiological relationship between the electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart activity. It simulates the cardiac cycle phases and their correlation with ECG patterns, providing a visually engaging experience for students, educators, and healthcare trainees.

âœ¨ It was a Tuesday at 12 PM when our anatomy lecture began, led by the incredible professor who always inspired us to think creatively and transform theoretical science into practical, impactful projects. I consider myself fortunate to learn anatomy under such a visionary teacher.

ðŸ“š That day, the professor delved into the cardiac cycle, explaining how ECG patterns relate to the cycle, action potentials, and their influence on the ECG output. It was fascinating to see the intricate relationship between physiology and technology unfold before our eyes.

ðŸ’¡ As someone driven by my personal motto, _"A lover of making human life easier,"_ I felt inspired to create something meaningful. This inspiration gave birth to the idea of developing an engaging and interactive tool to help future doctors and nurses master this complex topic in a way that is both educational and enjoyable.
